During the early 1950s, one of Luton's greatest sides emerged under manager Dally Duncan. 
The team included Gordon Turner, who went on to become Luton's all-time top goalscorer, Bob Morton, who holds the record for the most club appearances, and Syd Owen, an England international.

During this period, Luton sides also featured two England international goalkeepers, Ron Baynham and Bernard Streten, as well as Irish internationals Seamus Dunne, Tom Aherne and George Cummins. 
This team reached the top flight for the first time in 1955 to 1956, after finishing the season in second place behind Birmingham City on goal average.

A few years of success followed, including an FA Cup Final appearance against Nottingham Forest in 1958 to 1959; at the end of the season, Owen was voted FWA Footballer of the Year. 
However, the club was relegated the following season and, by 1964 to 1965, was playing in the fourth tier.
